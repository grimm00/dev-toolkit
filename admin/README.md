# Admin Directory

This directory contains project management, documentation, and coordination materials for the dev-toolkit project.

## Structure

### ðŸ“‹ `/planning`
Project planning and organization hub.

**Subdirectories:**
- **`/features`** - Feature-based planning and tracking
  - Each feature has its own directory (e.g., `testing-suite/`, `optional-sourcery/`)
  - Contains `feature-plan.md` and phase documents (`phase-1.md`, `phase-2.md`, etc.)
  - See [features/README.md](planning/features/README.md) for workflow

- **`/releases`** - Release management and documentation
  - Each release has its own directory (e.g., `v0.2.0/`)
  - Contains `checklist.md` and `release-notes.md`
  - See [releases/README.md](planning/releases/README.md) for process
  - See [releases/history.md](planning/releases/history.md) for all releases

- **`/phases`** - Historical phase tracking (Phase 1 foundation)

- **`/notes`** - Planning discussions, insights, and decision records

- **`roadmap.md`** - High-level project roadmap and priorities

### ðŸ’¬ `/chat-logs`
Conversation history with AI agents, organized by year.
- **`/2025`** - Current year's chat logs
- Significant sessions saved with descriptive filenames

### ðŸ“Š `/feedback`
External feedback and code reviews.
- **`/sourcery`** - Sourcery AI code review extracts
  - Organized by PR number (e.g., `pr06.md`, `pr08.md`)
  - Includes priority matrices and action plans

### ðŸ“„ `/docs`
*(Currently empty - reserved for future admin-specific documentation)*

### ðŸ§ª `/testing`
*(Currently empty - reserved for test plans and strategies)*

## Best Practices

### Opportunity Discovery
1. Document opportunities as they're discovered in `planning/notes/opportunities/`
2. Create subdirectory per opportunity: `{internal|external}/{feature-name}/`
3. Start with `analysis.md` to understand the problem
4. Create `proposal.md` or `*-idea.md` to design solution
5. Promote to feature when approved

### Feature Development
1. Create feature directory in `planning/features/`
2. Write `feature-plan.md` with vision and phases
3. Create phase documents as you go (`phase-1.md`, etc.)
4. Track progress with checkboxes
5. Document decisions and learnings

### Release Process
1. Create release directory in `planning/releases/vX.Y.Z/`
2. Use `checklist.md` to track release steps
3. Write polished `release-notes.md`
4. Update `history.md` and `roadmap.md`
5. Document lessons learned

### Chat Logs
1. Save significant AI conversations
2. Use descriptive filenames with dates
3. Include context about what was accomplished
4. Organize by year

### Feedback Management
1. Use `dt-review` to extract Sourcery reviews
2. Add priority matrices to assess suggestions
3. Create action plans for addressing feedback
4. Track which suggestions were implemented
