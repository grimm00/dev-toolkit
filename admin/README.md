## Purpose

The `admin/` directory serves as the coordination hub for:

- **Project Planning** - Tracking phases, roadmap, and progress
- **Documentation** - Maintaining technical guides and architecture decisions
- **Collaboration** - Recording discussions and decision-making processes

## Best Practices

1. **Chat Logs** - Save significant AI conversations with descriptive filenames
2. **Planning Notes** - Document major decisions and their rationale
3. **Phase Tracking** - Keep phase documents updated with progress
4. **Documentation** - Update docs as the project evolves
