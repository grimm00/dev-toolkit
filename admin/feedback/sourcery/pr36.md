## Overall Comments

- The tests now depend on the exact `**Recommended Model:**` markdown formatting and full model name string, which may be brittle if the presentation layer changes; consider matching more flexibly (e.g., regex around the model name) or centralizing the expected prefix in a helper.
- The rationale assertion for the explore workflow was tightened to specific phrases (`fast iteration` or `brainstorming`), which could make otherwise valid copy tweaks break the tests; consider asserting on a more stable semantic indicator (e.g., presence of any rationale line) rather than specific wording.

## Priority Matrix Assessment

| Comment | Priority | Impact | Effort | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Overall-#1 | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | 🟡 MEDIUM | Test brittleness concern - exact markdown formatting |
| Overall-#2 | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | Rationale assertion specificity |

**Assessment Summary:**

Both comments are LOW priority suggestions about test brittleness. The changes made in this PR actually *strengthen* the tests (the original purpose), and the concerns about brittleness are minor:

- **Overall-#1:** Tests now check specific model names which IS the point - to catch regressions if model mapping changes. Centralizing the prefix could be a future improvement.
- **Overall-#2:** The rationale assertion is intentionally specific to verify the correct rationale text appears. This is acceptable for current needs.

**Action:** Defer both - tests are functionally correct and achieve the goal of strengthening model recommendation validation.
