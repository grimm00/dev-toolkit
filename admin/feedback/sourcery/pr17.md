## Overall Comments

- This PR bundles extensive documentation and CI config changes in one go — consider splitting out the planning/docs additions into a separate PR so the CI setup can be reviewed in isolation.
- In each of the install job run steps, add strict shell options (e.g., set -euo pipefail) to ensure any unexpected errors cause the job to fail.
- Beyond testing --help flags, include at least one actual functionality check (e.g., --version or a simple command workflow) to validate that the commands do more than just output help text.
