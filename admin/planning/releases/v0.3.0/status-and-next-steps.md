## 🚀 Next Steps - Options

### Option A: Immediate Release [Recommended]

**Goal:** Release v0.3.0 as soon as validation complete

**Scope:**
- Complete pre-release validation checklist
- Merge develop to main
- Create release tag
- Test installation from main

**Estimated Effort:** 2.5 days

**Benefits:**
- Users get access to all features immediately
- Establishes release cadence
- Validates release process
- Provides user feedback opportunity

**Risks:**
- Limited testing on main branch
- Potential issues not caught
- User experience problems

---

### Option B: Extended Validation [Conservative]

**Goal:** Additional validation and testing before release

**Scope:**
- Extended pre-release validation
- Additional integration testing
- User acceptance testing
- Performance testing

**Estimated Effort:** 5 days

**Benefits:**
- Higher confidence in release quality
- Reduced risk of issues
- Better user experience
- More thorough validation

**Risks:**
- Delayed user access to features
- Over-engineering validation
- Reduced release velocity

---

### Option C: Phased Release [Balanced]

**Goal:** Release core features first, then additional features

**Scope:**
- Release core functionality first
- Follow with testing suite
- Then CI/CD enhancements
- Finally documentation improvements

**Estimated Effort:** 3 days

**Benefits:**
- Reduced risk through phasing
- Faster initial user access
- Incremental validation
- Easier rollback if needed

**Risks:**
- Complex release management
- User confusion with multiple releases
- Increased overhead
