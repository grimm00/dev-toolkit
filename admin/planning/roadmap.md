# Dev Toolkit Roadmap

**Status:** ✅ Foundation Complete  
**Current Version:** v0.1.1  
**Focus:** Feature Development & Enhancement

## Vision

Create a portable, project-agnostic development toolkit that streamlines code reviews, Git workflows, and project automation across multiple repositories.

## Core Principles

1. **Portability** - Works in any project without modification
2. **Auto-Detection** - Intelligently discovers project context
3. **Modularity** - Use individual tools or the full suite
4. **Zero Dependencies** - Core features work with minimal requirements
5. **AI-Friendly** - Designed for seamless AI assistant integration

## 🎯 What's Been Built

### Foundation ✅ COMPLETED (v0.1.0-alpha)
**All core infrastructure is in place and working**

**Core Utilities:**
- ✅ `lib/core/github-utils.sh` - Project-agnostic GitHub operations
- ✅ `lib/git-flow/utils.sh` - Git Flow workflow utilities
- ✅ `lib/git-flow/safety.sh` - Automated safety checks
- ✅ `lib/sourcery/parser.sh` - Sourcery review extraction

**Commands:**
- ✅ `dt-git-safety` - Git Flow safety checks
- ✅ `dt-config` - Configuration management
- ✅ `dt-install-hooks` - Pre-commit hook installer
- ✅ `dt-sourcery-parse` - Parse Sourcery reviews
- ✅ `dt-setup-sourcery` - Interactive Sourcery setup

**Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Installation system (install.sh, dev-setup.sh)
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks with safety checks
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Admin structure for feature tracking

## 🚀 What's Next

### Near-Term Priorities

#### 1. Testing Suite 🎯 HIGH PRIORITY
**Why:** Ensure reliability as we add features

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Unit tests for core utilities
- [ ] Integration tests for commands
- [ ] CI/CD test automation
- [ ] Test coverage reporting

**Benefit:** Confidence in changes, catch regressions early

---

#### 2. Batch Operations 🎯 MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Why:** Process multiple PRs/branches efficiently

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Batch PR review extraction
- [ ] Multiple branch safety checks
- [ ] Bulk configuration operations
- [ ] Progress reporting

**Benefit:** Save time on repetitive operations

---

#### 3. Enhanced Git Flow 🎯 MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Why:** More workflow automation

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Interactive branch management
- [ ] PR creation helpers
- [ ] Merge automation with safety checks
- [ ] Branch cleanup utilities

**Benefit:** Streamlined daily workflows

---

### Future Enhancements 🔮

#### Parser Improvements
- Extract overall comments (not just inline)
- Multiple output formats
- Custom priority matrix templates

#### Advanced Automation
- AI-powered commit messages
- Automated changelog generation
- Code quality dashboards
- Integration with other review tools (CodeRabbit, etc.)

#### Workflow Templates
- Custom project templates
- Reusable workflow patterns
- Project scaffolding utilities

## 📝 Notes

### Origin Story
This toolkit emerged from the Pokehub project's need for portable Sourcery automation tools. Rather than copying scripts between projects, we're building a centralized, reusable toolkit.

### Key Decisions
1. **Bash over Python** - Maximum portability, minimal dependencies
2. **Global Installation** - Tools available system-wide
3. **Auto-Detection** - No manual configuration required
4. **Modular Design** - Use what you need, ignore the rest

### Related Projects
- **Pokehub** - Original source of utilities
- **REPO-Magic** - Inspired the automation approach

---

**Last Updated:** October 6, 2025  
**Next Review:** Before v0.2.0 planning

## 📁 Planning Structure

### Feature Development
Individual features are tracked in `admin/planning/features/`:
- Each feature has its own directory
- `feature-plan.md` - Overall vision and design
- `phase-N.md` - Implementation phases with progress tracking

**Example:** `features/optional-sourcery/`
- ✅ Phase 1 complete (documentation & messaging)
- Future phases can be added as needed

### Foundation Phase
Original foundation work documented in:
- `phases/phase1-foundation.md` - Initial setup (completed)

### This Roadmap
High-level view of:
- What's been built
- What's next (priorities)
- Future enhancements
- Version milestones
