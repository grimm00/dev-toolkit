# Dev Toolkit Roadmap

**Status:** ✅ Foundation & Testing Complete  
**Current Version:** v0.2.0-dev  
**Focus:** Feature Development & Enhancement

## Vision

Create a portable, project-agnostic development toolkit that streamlines code reviews, Git workflows, and project automation across multiple repositories.

## Core Principles

1. **Portability** - Works in any project without modification
2. **Auto-Detection** - Intelligently discovers project context
3. **Modularity** - Use individual tools or the full suite
4. **Zero Dependencies** - Core features work with minimal requirements
5. **AI-Friendly** - Designed for seamless AI assistant integration

## 📝 Notes

### Origin Story
This toolkit emerged from the Pokehub project's need for portable Sourcery automation tools. Rather than copying scripts between projects, we're building a centralized, reusable toolkit.

### Key Decisions
1. **Bash over Python** - Maximum portability, minimal dependencies
2. **Global Installation** - Tools available system-wide
3. **Auto-Detection** - No manual configuration required
4. **Modular Design** - Use what you need, ignore the rest

### Related Projects
- **Pokehub** - Original source of utilities
- **REPO-Magic** - Inspired the automation approach

---

**Last Updated:** October 6, 2025  
**Next Review:** After v0.2.0 release

## 📁 Planning Structure

### Feature Development
Individual features are tracked in `admin/planning/features/`:
- Each feature has its own directory
- `feature-plan.md` - Overall vision and design
- `phase-N.md` - Implementation phases with progress tracking

**Example:** `features/optional-sourcery/`
- ✅ Phase 1 complete (documentation & messaging)
- Future phases can be added as needed

### Foundation Phase
Original foundation work documented in:
- `phases/phase1-foundation.md` - Initial setup (completed)

### This Roadmap
High-level view of:
- What's been built
- What's next (priorities)
