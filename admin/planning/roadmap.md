# Dev Toolkit Roadmap

**Status:** ✅ Foundation & Testing Complete  
**Current Version:** v0.2.0-dev  
**Focus:** Feature Development & Enhancement

## Vision

Create a portable, project-agnostic development toolkit that streamlines code reviews, Git workflows, and project automation across multiple repositories.

## Core Principles

1. **Portability** - Works in any project without modification
2. **Auto-Detection** - Intelligently discovers project context
3. **Modularity** - Use individual tools or the full suite
4. **Zero Dependencies** - Core features work with minimal requirements
5. **AI-Friendly** - Designed for seamless AI assistant integration

- ✅ `lib/sourcery/parser.sh` - Sourcery review extraction

**Commands:**
- ✅ `dt-git-safety` - Git Flow safety checks
- ✅ `dt-config` - Configuration management
- ✅ `dt-install-hooks` - Pre-commit hook installer
- ✅ `dt-sourcery-parse` - Parse Sourcery reviews
- ✅ `dt-review` - Quick Sourcery review extraction
- ✅ `dt-setup-sourcery` - Interactive Sourcery setup

**Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Installation system (install.sh, dev-setup.sh)
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks with safety checks
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Admin structure for feature tracking

## 🚀 What's Next

### Near-Term Priorities

#### 1. Testing Suite ✅ COMPLETED (v0.2.0)
**Status:** All phases complete

**Completed:**
- [x] Phase 1: Setup & Infrastructure (bats-core, helpers, smoke tests)
- [x] Phase 2: Unit Tests (144 unit tests for core utilities)
- [x] Phase 3: Integration Tests (71 integration tests for all commands)
- [x] Comprehensive documentation (TESTING.md, troubleshooting guides)
- [x] CI/CD integration

**Results:**
- **215 total tests** (100% passing)
- **< 15 seconds** execution time
- **All commands tested** end-to-end
- **All Sourcery feedback** addressed (PRs #8, #9, #10)

**Benefit:** ✅ Achieved - High confidence in changes, regression prevention

---

#### 2. Batch Operations 🎯 MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Why:** Process multiple PRs/branches efficiently

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Batch PR review extraction
- [ ] Multiple branch safety checks
- [ ] Bulk configuration operations
- [ ] Progress reporting

**Benefit:** Save time on repetitive operations

---

#### 3. Enhanced Git Flow 🎯 MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Why:** More workflow automation

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Interactive branch management
- [ ] PR creation helpers
- [ ] Merge automation with safety checks
- [ ] Branch cleanup utilities

**Benefit:** Streamlined daily workflows

---

### Future Enhancements 🔮

#### Parser Improvements
- Extract overall comments (not just inline)
- Multiple output formats
- Custom priority matrix templates

#### Advanced Automation
- AI-powered commit messages
- Automated changelog generation
- Code quality dashboards
- Integration with other review tools (CodeRabbit, etc.)

#### Workflow Templates
- Custom project templates
- Reusable workflow patterns
- Project scaffolding utilities

## 📝 Notes

### Origin Story
This toolkit emerged from the Pokehub project's need for portable Sourcery automation tools. Rather than copying scripts between projects, we're building a centralized, reusable toolkit.

### Key Decisions
1. **Bash over Python** - Maximum portability, minimal dependencies
2. **Global Installation** - Tools available system-wide
3. **Auto-Detection** - No manual configuration required
4. **Modular Design** - Use what you need, ignore the rest

### Related Projects
- **Pokehub** - Original source of utilities
- **REPO-Magic** - Inspired the automation approach

**Last Updated:** October 6, 2025  
**Next Review:** Before v0.2.0 planning

## 📁 Planning Structure

### Feature Development
Individual features are tracked in `admin/planning/features/`:
- Each feature has its own directory
- `feature-plan.md` - Overall vision and design
- `phase-N.md` - Implementation phases with progress tracking

**Example:** `features/optional-sourcery/`
- ✅ Phase 1 complete (documentation & messaging)
- Future phases can be added as needed

### Foundation Phase
Original foundation work documented in:
- `phases/phase1-foundation.md` - Initial setup (completed)

### This Roadmap
High-level view of:
- What's been built
