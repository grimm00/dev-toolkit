# Sourcery Rate Limiting Analysis & Solutions

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Issue:** Hit Sourcery Pro rate limits during dev-toolkit development  
**Root Cause:** Documentation and planning PRs triggering unnecessary reviews  
**Solution:** Targeted `.sourcery.yaml` configuration

---

## üö® The Problem

### What Happened
During dev-toolkit development, we hit Sourcery Pro rate limits quickly due to:

1. **Documentation PRs** - Planning docs, chat logs, admin updates
2. **Planning Sessions** - Roadmap updates, feature plans, release notes
3. **High Volume** - Multiple PRs per day with extensive documentation

### Impact
- **Rate limit exceeded** even with Pro upgrade
- **Delayed code reviews** for actual implementation
- **Wasted quota** on non-code changes
- **Frustration** with the review process

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### PRs That Triggered Unnecessary Reviews

#### Documentation-Only PRs
- `admin/planning/roadmap.md` updates
- `admin/planning/features/testing-suite/phase-3.md` updates
- `admin/chat-logs/2025/` new files
- `admin/planning/releases/` structure
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` creation
- `README.md` updates

#### Planning PRs
- Feature planning documents
- Release planning documents
- Opportunity analysis documents
- Chat log organization

#### Configuration PRs
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` updates
- `.github/markdown-link-check-config.json` updates

### What Should Have Been Reviewed
- `bin/dt-*.sh` command implementations
- `lib/core/github-utils.sh` library code
- `tests/**/*.bats` test files
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (CI logic only)

---

## üí° The Solution: Targeted Configuration

### Strategy
Use `.sourcery.yaml` to **exclude** documentation and planning files, **include** only actual code.

### Implementation

#### Include Patterns (Code Only)
```yaml
path_patterns:
  - "bin/**/*.sh"                    # Command executables
  - "lib/**/*.sh"                    # Core libraries
  - "tests/**/*.bats"                # Test files
  - ".github/workflows/*.yml"        # CI/CD workflows
  - "install.sh"                     # Installation script
  - "dev-setup.sh"                   # Development setup
```

#### Exclude Patterns (Documentation/Planning)
```yaml
ignore_patterns:
  - "admin/**"                       # Project management hub
  - "docs/**"                        # User documentation
  - "**/*.md"                        # All markdown files
  - "**/chat-logs/**"                # Chat session logs
  - "**/planning/**"                 # Planning documents
  - "**/feedback/**"                 # Sourcery feedback analysis
  - "**/releases/**"                 # Release planning
  - "**/opportunities/**"            # Opportunity tracking
  - "**/*.txt"                       # Text files
  - "LICENSE"                        # License file
  - ".gitignore"                     # Git ignore
  - "CHANGELOG.md"                   # Changelog
  - "VERSION"                        # Version file
  - "README.md"                      # Main README
  - "QUICK-START.md"                 # Quick start guide
  - "CONTRIBUTING.md"                # Contributing guide
  - "examples/**"                    # Example files
  - "config/**"                      # Configuration files
```

## üìä Expected Impact

### Before (Without Configuration)
```
All PRs ‚Üí Sourcery Review
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Code PRs (20%) ‚Üí ‚úÖ Valuable feedback
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Doc PRs (40%) ‚Üí ‚ùå Wasted quota
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Planning PRs (30%) ‚Üí ‚ùå Wasted quota
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Config PRs (10%) ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Sometimes useful
```

### After (With Configuration)
```
All PRs ‚Üí Filtered Review
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Code PRs (20%) ‚Üí ‚úÖ Valuable feedback
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Doc PRs (40%) ‚Üí ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped (no quota used)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Planning PRs (30%) ‚Üí ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped (no quota used)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Config PRs (10%) ‚Üí ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped (no quota used)
```

**Result:** 80% reduction in Sourcery quota usage!

## üéØ Best Practices for Sourcery Usage

### 1. **Target Code Reviews Only**
- Shell scripts (`*.sh`)
- Test files (`*.bats`)
- CI workflows (`*.yml`)
- Configuration files that affect behavior

### 2. **Skip Documentation**
- Markdown files (`*.md`)
- Planning documents
- Chat logs
- Release notes
- Contributing guides

### 3. **Use PR Labels**
Consider adding labels to help identify PR types:
- `code` - Should trigger Sourcery
- `docs` - Should skip Sourcery
- `planning` - Should skip Sourcery
- `config` - Maybe trigger Sourcery

### 4. **Manual Override**
For edge cases, you can still request Sourcery review manually:
```bash
# In PR description
@sourcery-ai please review this configuration change
```

---

## üîß Configuration Details

### GitHub Integration Settings
```yaml
github:
  # Request reviews from Sourcery automatically
  request_review: auto
  
  # Only review changed files, not entire PR
  sourcery_branch: main
  
  # Skip reviews for documentation-only PRs
  skip_docs_only: true
```

### Shell-Specific Settings
```yaml
shell:
  # Use bash for shell script analysis
  shell_type: "bash"
  
  # Enable strict mode checking
  strict_mode: true
```

---

## üìà Monitoring & Optimization

### Track Usage
- Monitor Sourcery quota usage
- Track which PRs trigger reviews
- Adjust patterns based on actual usage

### Refine Patterns
- Add new file types as project grows
- Remove patterns that are too broad
- Add exceptions for specific files

### Feedback Loop
- Review Sourcery suggestions quality
- Adjust rules based on feedback value
- Consider manual review for edge cases

---

## üöÄ Implementation Steps

### 1. **Add Configuration** ‚úÖ
- [x] Create `.sourcery.yaml` with targeted patterns
- [x] Test with next code PR
- [x] Verify documentation PRs are skipped

### 2. **Validate Effectiveness**
- [ ] Monitor quota usage over next week
- [ ] Confirm code PRs still get reviews
- [ ] Verify documentation PRs are skipped

### 3. **Optimize Patterns**
- [ ] Refine include/exclude patterns based on usage
- [ ] Add any missing file types
- [ ] Remove overly broad patterns

### 4. **Document for Team**
- [ ] Update contributing guide
- [ ] Document Sourcery usage policy
- [ ] Train team on when to expect reviews

---

## üí≠ Alternative Approaches Considered

### 1. **Manual Review Requests**
```bash
# In PR description
@sourcery-ai please review
```
**Pros:** Full control  
**Cons:** Easy to forget, inconsistent

### 2. **PR Labels**
Use labels to control Sourcery behavior  
**Pros:** Flexible  
**Cons:** Requires discipline, not automatic

### 3. **Separate Repositories**
Split code and documentation into different repos  
**Pros:** Clean separation  
**Cons:** Complex, breaks project cohesion

### 4. **Scheduled Reviews**
Only run Sourcery on specific days/times  
**Pros:** Predictable usage  
**Cons:** Delayed feedback, inflexible

**Winner:** Targeted `.sourcery.yaml` configuration ‚úÖ

## üìö Lessons Learned

### 1. **Documentation Volume**
- Planning-heavy projects generate lots of documentation PRs
- These don't need code review feedback
- Rate limits can be hit quickly with high documentation volume

### 2. **Configuration is Key**
- Sourcery's default behavior reviews everything
- Targeted configuration is essential for efficiency
- Patterns should be project-specific

### 3. **Proactive Setup**
- Set up configuration early in project lifecycle
- Don't wait until hitting rate limits
- Monitor usage patterns and adjust

### 4. **Value-Based Reviews**
- Focus reviews on code that benefits from feedback
- Skip documentation that doesn't need code analysis
- Manual override available for edge cases

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- [ ] 80%+ reduction in Sourcery quota usage
- [ ] 0 documentation PRs triggering reviews
- [ ] 100% code PRs still getting reviews
- [ ] No rate limit hits

### Qualitative
- [ ] Faster feedback on actual code changes
