# Feature Transition Plan - dt-workflow

**Feature:** dt-workflow - Unified Workflow Orchestration  
**Status:** 🟠 Planning Complete  
**Created:** 2026-01-22  
**Source:** [ADRs](../../decisions/dt-workflow/)  
**Type:** Feature

---

## 📋 Overview

Transition from exploration/research/decisions to production implementation of the dt-workflow unified command.

**Current State:** Spike validated (v0.1.0-spike)  
**Target State:** Production release (v0.2.0+)

---

## 🎯 Transition Goals

1. Transform spike code into production-quality implementation
2. Implement all three workflows (explore, research, decision)
3. Integrate with Cursor commands per orchestrator pattern
4. Establish comprehensive test coverage
5. Document user workflows and patterns

  - [ ] Update dt-workflow to use render.sh instead of heredocs
  - [ ] Document template variable contract
- [ ] **Research Workflow:**
  - [ ] Implement research workflow structure generation
  - [ ] Implement research context gathering
- [ ] **Decision Workflow:**
  - [ ] Implement decision workflow structure generation
  - [ ] Implement decision context gathering
- [ ] **Workflow Chaining:**
  - [ ] Add handoff file generation
  - [ ] Add --from-* flag support

**Deliverables:**
- Enhanced templates in dev-infra (structural examples)
- Research workflow support
- Decision workflow support
- Workflow chaining via handoff files
- Template variable documentation

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Templates enhanced with structural examples (FR-24)
- [ ] Templates use render.sh (NFR-7 alignment)
- [ ] `dt-workflow research` works end-to-end
- [ ] `dt-workflow decision` works end-to-end
- [ ] Handoff files validated
- [ ] Tests for all workflows

---

### Phase 3: Cursor Integration

**Goal:** Update Cursor commands to use dt-workflow as orchestrator

**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours

**Prerequisites:**
- [ ] Phase 2 complete

**Key Tasks:**
- [ ] Update `/explore` command
- [ ] Update `/research` command
- [ ] Update `/decision` command
- [ ] Test full workflow chain
- [ ] Update command documentation

**Deliverables:**
- Updated Cursor commands
- End-to-end workflow validation

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] All Cursor commands use dt-workflow
- [ ] Full workflow chain tested
- [ ] Documentation updated

---

### Phase 4: Enhancement

**Goal:** Add advanced features and prepare for future phases

**Estimated Effort:** 8-10 hours

**Prerequisites:**
- [ ] Phase 3 complete

**Key Tasks:**
