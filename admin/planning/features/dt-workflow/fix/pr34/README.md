## 🎯 Batch Overview

### Batch 1: Test Specificity (medium-low-01)

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM | **Effort:** 🟢 LOW | **Time:** ~1 hour

Strengthen model recommendation tests to assert specific model names per workflow type, not just that recommendations exist.

**Issues:**
- PR34-#1: Update test assertions to check specific models (claude-3-5-sonnet, claude-3-opus)

**Files:** `tests/unit/test-model-recommendations.bats`

---

### Batch 2: Performance Test Reliability (medium-medium-01)

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM | **Effort:** 🟡 MEDIUM | **Time:** ~2-3 hours

Address concerns about performance test flakiness in CI environments by relaxing timing thresholds and improving robustness.

**Issues:**
- PR34-#2: Relax 1s threshold to 5s to reduce CI flakiness
- PR34-Overall-1: Review all timing thresholds (<1s, <500ms, <200ms)

**Files:** `tests/unit/test-performance.bats`

---

### Batch 3: Portability (low-medium-01)

**Priority:** 🟢 LOW | **Effort:** 🟡 MEDIUM | **Time:** ~1-2 hours

Assess and potentially improve portability of `date +%s%N` timing approach across different Unix-like systems.

**Issues:**
- PR34-Overall-2: `date +%s%N` may not be portable to all BSD variants

**Files:** `tests/unit/test-performance.bats`, potentially `tests/helpers/portable-time.sh`

---

## 📈 Implementation Order

**Recommended order:**

1. **Batch 1** (medium-low-01) - Quickest win, improves test quality
2. **Batch 2** (medium-medium-01) - Addresses primary robustness concern
3. **Batch 3** (low-medium-01) - Lowest priority, only if broader platform support needed

## 🔍 Deferred Reasoning

All issues in this PR were deferred because:

1. **Test Specificity (#1):**
   - Functional correctness already verified via manual testing
   - Current tests do validate the feature works
   - More specific assertions can be added when model selection logic becomes more complex

2. **Performance Test Reliability (#2, Overall-1):**
   - Current thresholds have 3x+ margin (1s threshold, ~300ms actual)
   - No flakiness observed in current CI runs
   - Tests do validate performance requirements
   - Will monitor CI before adjusting

3. **Portability (Overall-2):**
   - macOS and Linux both support `date +%s%N`
   - No platform-specific failures observed
   - Only relevant if supporting older macOS or other BSD variants

**Overall Assessment:** All issues are code quality improvements with no impact on functional correctness or immediate user experience.
