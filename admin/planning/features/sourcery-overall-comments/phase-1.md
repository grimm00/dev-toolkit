# Phase 1: Core Functionality Implementation

**Status:** üü† In Progress  
**Started:** 2025-10-06  
**Duration:** 1-2 days (estimated)  
**PR:** TBD

## üìã Overview

Implement the core Overall Comments extraction functionality in the Sourcery parser. This phase adds the ability to detect and extract Overall Comments sections from Sourcery reviews while maintaining full backward compatibility.

### Goals

1. **Add Overall Comments Detection** - Identify Overall Comments sections in Sourcery reviews
2. **Extract Overall Comments Content** - Capture the content of Overall Comments sections
3. **Integrate into Output** - Include Overall Comments in parser output
4. **Maintain Compatibility** - Ensure existing functionality remains unchanged

- [ ] Overall Comments content extracted and cleaned
- [ ] Overall Comments included in parser output
- [ ] Summary indicates presence of Overall Comments
- [ ] Individual comments functionality unchanged

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Add `extract_overall_comments()` Function ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete  
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Implementation:**
```bash
extract_overall_comments() {
    local content="$1"
    local overall_section=""
    local in_overall=false
    
    while IFS= read -r line; do
        # Check for start of Overall Comments section
        if [[ "$line" =~ ^##\ (Overall\ Comments|Overall|Summary\ Comments) ]]; then
            in_overall=true
            continue
        fi
        
        # Check for end of Overall Comments section (next major section)
        if [ "$in_overall" = true ] && [[ "$line" =~ ^##\ [^O] ]] && [[ ! "$line" =~ ^##\ (Overall|Summary) ]]; then
            break
        fi
        
        # Collect content while in Overall Comments section
        if [ "$in_overall" = true ]; then
            if [ -n "$overall_section" ]; then
                overall_section="$overall_section"$'\n'"$line"
            else
                overall_section="$line"
            fi
        fi
    done <<< "$content"
    
    # Clean up the overall section (remove leading/trailing empty lines)
    overall_section=$(echo "$overall_section" | sed '/^$/N;/^\n$/d' | sed '1{/^$/d;}' | sed '$ {/^$/d;}')
    
    echo "$overall_section"
}
```

**Features:**
- Detects multiple header formats: `## Overall Comments`, `## Overall`, `## Summary Comments`
- Extracts content until next major section
- Cleans up whitespace
- Returns empty string if no Overall Comments found

```bash
# Check for Overall Comments section first
local overall_comments=""
if echo "$content" | grep -q "## Overall Comments\|## Overall\|## Summary Comments"; then
    overall_comments=$(extract_overall_comments "$content")
fi

# Add Overall Comments section if found
if [ -n "$overall_comments" ]; then
    output+="## Overall Comments\n\n"
    output+="$overall_comments\n\n"
fi
```

fi

output+="Total Individual Comments: $comment_count$has_overall_comments\n\n"
```

**Features:**
- Detects Overall Comments presence
- Updates summary to indicate Overall Comments

```

**Features:**
- Documents Overall Comments detection patterns
- Explains parsing approach
- Maintains existing think mode functionality

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- **Function isolation:** Test `extract_overall_comments()` independently
- **Edge cases:** Missing sections, different formats, whitespace
- **Boundary conditions:** Empty content, malformed headers

### Integration Tests
- **Real data:** Test with actual PR #39 from Pokehub
- **Mock data:** Test with simulated Sourcery review content
- **Output validation:** Verify generated markdown format

### Regression Tests
- **Existing functionality:** Ensure individual comments still work
- **Command options:** Verify all existing options still work
- **Output format:** Ensure consistent formatting

---

## üéØ Expected Results

### Before (Current Behavior)
```bash
dt-sourcery-parse 39
```

**Output:**
```markdown
## Summary
Total Individual Comments: 3

## Individual Comments
[individual comments content]

## Priority Matrix Assessment
[matrix content]
```

### After (Expected Behavior)
```bash
dt-sourcery-parse 39
```

**Output:**
```markdown
## Summary
Total Individual Comments: 3 + Overall Comments

## Individual Comments
[individual comments content]

## Overall Comments
This PR looks good overall, but consider:
- Adding functional tests in addition to structure tests
- Extracting helper functions for better maintainability
- Splitting large files into smaller modules

## Priority Matrix Assessment
[matrix content]
```

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Fix test runner** - Resolve test helper path issue
2. **Run unit tests** - Verify `extract_overall_comments()` function
3. **Test with PR #39** - Validate with real data
