# Sourcery Overall Comments Enhancement - Feature Plan

**Status:** ✅ Phase 1 Complete  
**Created:** 2025-10-06  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-07  
**Priority:** Medium

---

## 📋 Overview

Enhance the `dt-sourcery-parse` command to capture "Overall Comments" sections from Sourcery reviews. Currently, the parser only captures individual line comments but misses valuable high-level feedback that Sourcery sometimes provides.

### Goals

1. **Complete Review Capture** - Extract both individual and overall comments
2. **Maintain Backward Compatibility** - Existing functionality unchanged
3. **Improve Decision Making** - Provide complete review analysis
4. **Resolve User Issue** - Address GitHub Issue #11

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [x] ✅ Overall Comments sections are detected and extracted
- [x] ✅ Overall Comments are included in parser output
- [x] ✅ Summary indicates presence of Overall Comments
- [x] ✅ Individual comments continue to work unchanged
- [x] ✅ All existing tests pass
- [x] ✅ New tests cover Overall Comments functionality
- [ ] Issue #11 is resolved (pending PR creation)
- [x] ✅ Documentation is updated

**Progress:** 7/8 complete (87.5%)

## 🚫 Out of Scope

**Excluded from this feature:**
- ❌ **Priority Matrix Integration** - Overall Comments won't be added to priority matrix (they're high-level feedback, not actionable items)
- ❌ **Overall Comments Parsing** - Won't try to extract structured data from Overall Comments (they're free-form text)
- ❌ **Multiple Overall Comments** - Won't handle multiple Overall Comments sections (Sourcery typically provides one)
- ❌ **Overall Comments Formatting** - Won't try to format or structure Overall Comments content
