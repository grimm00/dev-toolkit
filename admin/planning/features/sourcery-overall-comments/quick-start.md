# Sourcery Overall Comments Enhancement - Quick Start

**Purpose:** How to test and use the Overall Comments enhancement  
**Status:** 🟠 In Progress  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-06

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Testing the Enhancement

```bash
# Test with PR that has Overall Comments
dt-sourcery-parse 39

# Expected output should include:
# ## Overall Comments
# [overall feedback content]
```

### Current vs Expected Behavior

#### Current Behavior (Before Enhancement)
```bash
dt-sourcery-parse 39
```

**Output:**
```markdown
# Sourcery Review Analysis
**PR**: #39
**Repository**: grimm00/pokehub
**Generated**: 2025-10-06

---

## Summary
Total Individual Comments: 3

## Individual Comments
[individual comments content]

## Priority Matrix Assessment
[matrix content]
```

#### Expected Behavior (After Enhancement)
```bash
dt-sourcery-parse 39
```

**Output:**
```markdown
# Sourcery Review Analysis
**PR**: #39
**Repository**: grimm00/pokehub
**Generated**: 2025-10-06

---

## Summary
Total Individual Comments: 3 + Overall Comments

## Individual Comments
[individual comments content]

## Overall Comments
This PR looks good overall, but consider:
- Adding functional tests in addition to structure tests
- Extracting helper functions for better maintainability
- Splitting large files into smaller modules

## Priority Matrix Assessment
[matrix content]
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Commands

### Test with Real Data
```bash
# Test with PR #39 from Pokehub (has Overall Comments)
dt-sourcery-parse 39

# Test with other PRs that might have Overall Comments
dt-sourcery-parse [PR_NUMBER]
```

### Test with Mock Data
```bash
# Create test file with Overall Comments
cat > test-review.md << 'EOF'
## Individual Comments

### Comment 1
Some individual comment

## Overall Comments

This PR looks good overall, but consider:
- Adding functional tests
- Extracting helper functions

## Priority Matrix Assessment
Some matrix content
EOF

# Test extraction function (when implemented)
# [Testing commands will be added during implementation]
```

### Verify Existing Functionality
```bash
# Test that individual comments still work
dt-sourcery-parse [PR_WITH_INDIVIDUAL_COMMENTS]

# Test that parser still works without Overall Comments
dt-sourcery-parse [PR_WITHOUT_OVERALL_COMMENTS]
```
