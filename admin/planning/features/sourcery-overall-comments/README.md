## 🎯 Overview

Enhance the `dt-sourcery-parse` command to capture "Overall Comments" sections from Sourcery reviews, in addition to the existing individual line comments.

### Goals

1. **Capture Overall Comments** - Extract high-level feedback from Sourcery
2. **Maintain Compatibility** - Keep existing individual comments functionality
3. **Improve Documentation** - Complete review analysis for better decision-making
4. **Resolve Issue #11** - Address user-reported missing functionality

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Testing the Enhancement

```bash
# Test with PR that has Overall Comments
dt-sourcery-parse 39

# Expected output should include:
# ## Overall Comments
# [overall feedback content]
```

### Current Behavior
```bash
# Only captures individual comments
dt-sourcery-parse 39
# Output: Individual Comments + Priority Matrix
```

### Expected Behavior
```bash
# Captures both individual AND overall comments
dt-sourcery-parse 39
# Output: Individual Comments + Overall Comments + Priority Matrix
```
