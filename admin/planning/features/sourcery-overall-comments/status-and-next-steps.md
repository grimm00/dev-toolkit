## 🔍 Feedback Summary

### GitHub Issue #11 Analysis
- **Reported by:** Pokehub team
- **Problem:** Missing Overall Comments in `dt-sourcery-parse` output
- **Test Case:** PR #39 has Overall Comments that aren't captured
- **Impact:** Missing valuable high-level Sourcery feedback

### Technical Analysis
- **Current Parser:** Only captures `### Comment N` patterns
- **Missing Logic:** No detection of `## Overall Comments` sections
- **Solution:** Add extraction function and integrate into output

---

## 🎊 Key Insights

### What We Learned

1. **Sourcery Review Structure**
   - Individual comments: `### Comment N`
   - Overall comments: `## Overall Comments` (or similar)
   - Both can exist in same review

2. **User Impact**
   - Overall Comments often contain high-level feedback
   - Missing this content reduces review completeness
   - Manual copy/paste is current workaround

3. **Technical Approach**
   - Additive enhancement (no breaking changes)
   - Extract and include as separate section
   - Maintain existing individual comments functionality

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

**Benefits:**
- Complete, polished feature
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Full documentation
- Issue resolved

---

### Option C: Minimal Implementation 🟢 Conservative

**Goal:** Basic Overall Comments support

**Scope:**
- Simple Overall Comments detection
- Basic extraction
- Minimal testing
- Quick validation

**Estimated Effort:** 0.5-1 day

**Benefits:**
- Quick implementation

- Low risk
- Can enhance later

---

## 📋 Recommendation

**Recommended Path:** Option A (Implement Core Functionality Now)

**Rationale:**
1. **User Need** - Addresses real issue reported by Pokehub team
2. **Low Risk** - Additive feature, no breaking changes
3. **Immediate Value** - Can test with real PR #39 data
4. **Manageable Scope** - Clear, focused implementation
5. **Foundation** - Sets up for comprehensive testing later

**Timeline:**
- **Today:** Implement core functionality
- **Tomorrow:** Test with PR #39 and add basic tests
- **Next:** Enhance with comprehensive testing if needed

## 🎯 Implementation Details

### Core Function to Add
```bash
extract_overall_comments() {
    local content="$1"
    # Search for ## Overall Comments, ## Overall, ## Summary Comments
    # Extract content until next major section
    # Clean up whitespace
    # Return extracted content
}
```

### Output Modification
```bash
# In create_clean_output()
local overall_comments=""
if echo "$content" | grep -q "## Overall Comments\|## Overall\|## Summary Comments"; then
    overall_comments=$(extract_overall_comments "$content")
fi

# Add to output
if [ -n "$overall_comments" ]; then
    output+="## Overall Comments\n\n"
    output+="$overall_comments\n\n"
fi
```

### Summary Update
```bash
local has_overall_comments=""
if echo "$content" | grep -q "## Overall Comments\|## Overall\|## Summary Comments"; then
    has_overall_comments=" + Overall Comments"
fi

output+="Total Individual Comments: $comment_count$has_overall_comments\n\n"
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Immediate Testing
- **PR #39 from Pokehub** - Real data with Overall Comments
- **Mock data** - Simulated Sourcery review content
- **Edge cases** - Missing sections, different formats

### Validation Criteria
- Overall Comments detected and extracted ✅
- Overall Comments included in output ✅
- Individual comments unchanged ✅
- Summary indicates Overall Comments presence ✅
