# CI/CD Installation Testing - CI Plan

**Status:** 🟡 Planned
**Created:** 2025-01-06
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-06
**Priority:** High

---

## 📋 Overview

The current CI/CD pipeline validates `install.sh` syntax and permissions but doesn't test the actual installation process. This feature adds comprehensive installation testing to ensure the installer works correctly in CI environments.

### Context

**Current State:**
- ✅ `install.sh` syntax validation
- ✅ `install.sh` executable permissions
- ❌ No installation process testing
- ❌ No verification of installed commands

**Problem:**
- Users might encounter installation failures not caught by CI
- No confidence that `install.sh` works in different environments
- No verification that installed commands are accessible

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] Global installation test passes in CI
- [ ] Local installation test passes in CI
- [ ] Installed commands are accessible and functional
- [ ] Installation test job runs on all PRs and main pushes
- [ ] Test execution time < 2 minutes
- [ ] Documentation updated with CI/CD best practices

**Progress:** 0/6 complete (0%)

---

## 🚫 Out of Scope

**Excluded from this feature:**
- ❌ Testing installation on different OS (Ubuntu only for now)
- ❌ Testing installation with different shell environments
- ❌ Performance testing of installation process
- ❌ Testing installation with missing dependencies
- ❌ Testing installation rollback scenarios

## 📅 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Installation Test Job [Planned]

**Status:** 🟡 Planned
**Duration:** 1-2 days
**PR:** TBD

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create installation test job in CI workflow
- [ ] Test global installation process
- [ ] Test local installation process
- [ ] Verify installed commands are accessible
- [ ] Add installation test to CI triggers

**Result:** Basic installation testing in CI

---

### Phase 2: Integration Testing [Planned]

**Status:** 🟡 Planned
**Duration:** 1 day
**PR:** TBD

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Test installation → command usage workflow
- [ ] Test installation with different PR contexts
- [ ] Test installation cleanup and isolation
- [ ] Verify installation doesn't affect other CI jobs

**Result:** Comprehensive installation integration testing

---

### Phase 3: Documentation & Best Practices [Planned]

**Status:** 🟡 Planned
**Duration:** 1 day
**PR:** TBD

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Document CI/CD installation testing patterns
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for installation failures
- [ ] Update CI/CD documentation
- [ ] Create reusable patterns for other projects

**Result:** Complete documentation and best practices

---

## 🎉 Success Metrics
