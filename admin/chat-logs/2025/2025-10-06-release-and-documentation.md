## Lessons Learned

### Release Process

1. **Use PRs for Release Branches**
   - We merged directly to main instead of creating a PR
   - This meant we didn't catch the link checker issue until after merging
   - **Lesson:** Always create a PR from release branch to main to test CI first

2. **Link Checker Configuration**
   - Markdown link checker treats relative paths as HTTP requests
   - Planning documents need to be excluded or use absolute URLs
   - **Solution:** Added `ignoreFiles` pattern for planning directories

3. **Hotfix Process Works Well**
   - When CI failed on main, we quickly created a hotfix branch
   - Fixed the issue and merged back
   - **Lesson:** The hotfix process is smooth and effective

4. **Checklist is Invaluable**
   - Having a detailed checklist made the release process straightforward
   - Ensured we didn't miss any steps
   - **Lesson:** Always use a checklist for releases

### Documentation

1. **Fork-First Installation**
   - Original instructions were confusing ("yourusername" placeholder)
   - **Solution:** Clear fork-first approach with generic "YOUR_USERNAME"
   - This is the standard open-source pattern

2. **Project Structure Documentation**
   - Having a comprehensive structure guide is essential for handoff
   - Explains the "why" behind each directory
   - **Lesson:** Document structure early and keep it updated

3. **Contributing Guidelines**
   - Clear guidelines lower the barrier to entry
   - Ensures consistent quality
   - **Lesson:** Create CONTRIBUTING.md early in the project
