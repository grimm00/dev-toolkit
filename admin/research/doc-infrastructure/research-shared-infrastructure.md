## 🎯 Research Question

How should dt-doc-gen and dt-doc-validate share code while evolving independently? Both commands need: path detection, dev-infra location, debug output, help formatting. However, they serve different purposes and may need independent releases.

---

## 🔍 Research Goals

- [ ] Goal 1: List common functionality between commands
- [ ] Goal 2: Evaluate existing lib/core/ utilities for reuse
- [ ] Goal 3: Define boundary: what's shared vs command-specific
- [ ] Goal 4: Document versioning strategy (monorepo-style or independent)
