# Rule Loading Functions for dt-doc-validate
# Implements pre-compiled .bash rule loading per ADR-002
#
# This library provides functions to load validation rules from pre-compiled
# .bash files. Rules are converted from YAML to bash at build-time in dev-infra,
# eliminating runtime YAML parsing dependencies.
