# Post Release Command

Handles post-release tasks including merging main back to develop, updating historical tracking, archiving release documents, and optionally creating a release retrospective.

---

## Configuration

**Path Detection:**

This command supports multiple project organization patterns:

1. **Dev-Infra Structure (default):**
   - Releases: `admin/planning/releases/[version]/`
   - Scripts: `scripts/`
   - Historical: `admin/planning/releases/history/` (if exists)

2. **Template Structure (for generated projects):**
   - Releases: `docs/maintainers/planning/releases/[version]/`

**Version Detection:**

- Use version argument (required)
- Format: `v0.4.0` or `0.4.0` (normalized to `vX.Y.Z`)

---

## Workflow Overview

**When to use:**

- After release is merged to main (tag created automatically)
- After GitHub release is published
- To clean up and prepare for next development cycle

**Key principle:** Complete the release cycle and prepare for the next iteration.

**Note:** As of v0.5.0, tags are automatically created when release PRs are merged to `main` via `.github/workflows/create-release-tag.yml`.

**Workflow Position:**

```
/pr --release
         │
         ▼
   Merge to main
         │
         ▼
   Tag auto-created (v0.4.0)  ◄── Automated by GitHub Actions
         │
         ▼
   GitHub release published
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   /post-release v0.4.0              │  ◄── This command

│   5. Create retrospective (opt)     │

```

## Usage

**Command:** `/post-release [version] [options]`

**Examples:**

- `/post-release v0.4.0` - Full post-release workflow
- `/post-release v0.4.0 --dry-run` - Preview changes
- `/post-release v0.4.0 --skip-retrospective` - Skip retrospective creation
- `/post-release v0.4.0 --keep-branch` - Don't delete release branch

**Options:**

- `--dry-run` - Show what would be done without executing
- `--skip-retrospective` - Skip retrospective document creation
- `--keep-branch` - Keep release branch (don't delete)
- `--skip-archive` - Skip archiving release documents
- `--force` - Continue even with warnings

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Validate Release Complete

**Verify release is complete:**

```bash
# Check tag exists
git tag -l "v0.4.0"

# Check tag is on main
git branch -a --contains v0.4.0 | grep main
```

**Check GitHub release (if applicable):**

```bash
gh release view v0.4.0
```

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Tag v0.4.0 exists
- [ ] Tag is on main branch
- [ ] GitHub release exists (if applicable)
- [ ] Release distribution workflow completed

---

### 2. Merge Main to Develop

**Purpose:** Ensure develop has all release changes and any hotfixes.

**Process:**

```bash
# Switch to develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Merge main
git merge main --no-edit

# Push
git push origin develop
```

**Handle conflicts (if any):**

- Release-specific changes may conflict
- Prefer main branch versions for release files
- Document any manual conflict resolution

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Develop branch checkout
- [ ] Main merged to develop
- [ ] Conflicts resolved (if any)
- [ ] Develop pushed

---

### 3. Update Historical Tracking

**Run historical analysis:**

**Dev-Infra (with script):**
```bash
./scripts/analyze-releases.sh --last 5
```

**Output example:**

```
Release History Analysis
========================

Recent Releases:
  v0.4.0 (2025-12-11) - Score: 85%, Status: READY
  v0.3.0 (2025-11-18) - Score: 90%, Status: READY
  v0.2.0 (2025-11-12) - Score: 88%, Status: READY

Trends:
  Average Readiness Score: 87.7%
  Trend: Stable
```

**Update historical index (if exists):**

**File:** `admin/planning/releases/history/index.md` (create if needed)

```markdown
# Release History

| Version | Date | Score | PRs | Highlights |
|---------|------|-------|-----|------------|
| v0.4.0 | 2025-12-11 | 85% | 22 | Release Readiness Feature |
| v0.3.0 | 2025-11-18 | 90% | 8 | Multi-Environment Testing |
| v0.2.0 | 2025-11-12 | 88% | 5 | Directory Selection |
```

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Historical analysis run
- [ ] Index updated (if exists)
- [ ] Trends documented

---

### 4. Archive Release Documents

**Purpose:** Mark release documents as complete and archived.

**Update document statuses:**

**RELEASE-READINESS.md:**
```markdown
# Before
**Status:** 🟢 READY FOR RELEASE

# After
**Status:** ✅ RELEASED (v0.4.0 - 2025-12-11)
```

**RELEASE-NOTES.md:**
```markdown
# Before  
**Status:** ✅ Final

# After
**Status:** ✅ Published (GitHub Release)
```

**Move to archive (optional):**

If using archive structure:
```bash
mkdir -p admin/planning/releases/archived/v0.4.0/
mv admin/planning/releases/v0.4.0/* admin/planning/releases/archived/v0.4.0/
```

**Alternative:** Keep in place with updated status (recommended for easy reference).

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Document statuses updated
- [ ] Documents archived (if using archive structure)
- [ ] Links still work

---

### 5. Clean Up Release Branch

**Delete release branch (unless `--keep-branch`):**

```bash
# Delete local branch
git branch -d release/v0.4.0

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete release/v0.4.0
```

**Verify cleanup:**

```bash
git branch -a | grep release/v0.4.0
# Should return nothing
```

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Local branch deleted
- [ ] Remote branch deleted
- [ ] No orphaned branches

---

### 6. Create Release Retrospective (Optional)

**Skip if `--skip-retrospective` specified.**

**Create retrospective document:**

**File:** `admin/planning/releases/v0.4.0/retrospective.md`

```markdown
# Release Retrospective - v0.4.0

**Version:** v0.4.0  
**Release Date:** 2025-12-11  
**Created:** 2025-12-11
