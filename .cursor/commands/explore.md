# Explore Command

Initiate exploration cycles for proof of concepts or abstract ideas. Creates exploration documents and identifies research topics/questions that need investigation.

---

## Configuration

**Path Detection:**

This command supports multiple project organization patterns:

1. **Dev-Infra Structure (default):**
   - Explorations: `admin/explorations/[topic]/`

2. **Template Structure (for generated projects):**
   - Explorations: `docs/maintainers/planning/explorations/[topic]/`

3. **Project-Wide Structure:**
   - Explorations: `docs/maintainers/planning/explorations/[topic]/`

**Topic Detection:**
- Use `--topic` option if provided
- Otherwise, prompt user for topic name
- Sanitize topic name (kebab-case, no spaces)

---

## Workflow Overview

**When to use:**

- When you have a new idea or proof of concept
- To organize abstract thoughts before research
- When you need to identify what questions need answering
- Before starting research on a topic

**Key principle:** Start with exploration to identify research topics, then move to research phase. Use Setup Mode for quick ideation, then Conduct Mode for detailed exploration after human review.

**Two Modes:**

### Setup Mode (Default)

Creates lightweight scaffolding (~60-80 lines) for human review before investing in detailed exploration.

```
/explore [topic]
  → Creates exploration scaffolding (~60-80 lines)
  → Organizes thoughts into themes
  → Extracts key questions
  → Creates research-topics.md
  → Outputs: Scaffolding ready for human review
```

**When to use Setup Mode:**

- Starting a new exploration
- Quick ideation without committing to full exploration
- When you want to validate direction before deep dive

### Conduct Mode (`--conduct`)

Expands existing scaffolding with detailed analysis (~200-300 lines).

```
/explore [topic] --conduct
  → Reads existing scaffolding
  → Expands themes with detailed analysis
  → Adds connections, implications, concerns
  → Refines research topics with context
  → Outputs: Full exploration (~200-300 lines)
```

**When to use Conduct Mode:**

- After reviewing scaffolding and validating direction
- When ready to invest in detailed exploration
- Before moving to formal research phase

**Workflow with Human Review:**

```
/explore [topic]           ← Setup: scaffolding (~60-80 lines)
    ↓ human review         ← Key checkpoint
/explore [topic] --conduct ← Conduct: full exploration (~200-300 lines)
    ↓
/research --from-explore   ← Research: investigate topics
```

---

## Usage

**Command:** `/explore [topic] [options]`

**Setup Mode Examples (default):**

- `/explore new-authentication-system` - Create exploration scaffolding
- `/explore "improve ci pipeline"` - Topic sanitized to `improve-ci-pipeline`
- `/explore --topic database-choice` - Specify topic explicitly
- `/explore --dry-run` - Show what would be created without creating files

**Conduct Mode Examples:**

- `/explore new-authentication-system --conduct` - Expand existing scaffolding
- `/explore improve-ci-pipeline --conduct` - Fill in detailed exploration

**Options:**

- `--topic [name]` - Specify topic name (overrides prompt)
- `--conduct` - Expand scaffolding with detailed exploration (requires existing scaffolding)
- `--dry-run` - Show what would be created without creating files
- `--force` - Overwrite existing scaffolding (setup) or re-expand (conduct)

**Input Source Options:**

- `--input [text|file]` - Raw text inline or from file (primary input source)
- `--from-start` - Read project's start.txt as input
- `--from-reflect [file]` - Read reflection document for actionable suggestions

**Input Source Examples:**

- `/explore "I've been thinking about improving our auth system..."` - Inline raw text
- `/explore --input thoughts.txt` - Read from file
- `/explore --from-start` - Use project's start.txt
- `/explore --from-reflect reflection-2026-01-10.md` - Extract from reflection

**Note:** Input sources are mutually exclusive. If multiple specified, command errors. If none specified, prompts for topic interactively.

**Worktree Options (Conduct Mode only):**

- `--worktree` - Create worktree automatically (skip prompt)
- `--no-worktree` - Skip worktree prompt, stay on current branch

**Worktree Examples:**

- `/explore my-idea --conduct` - Prompts "Create worktree?"
- `/explore my-idea --conduct --worktree` - Auto-creates worktree
- `/explore my-idea --conduct --no-worktree` - Skips prompt, stays on current branch

**Note:** Worktree flags only apply to Conduct Mode. Setup Mode always stays on current branch.

---

## Input Sources

`/explore` is the pipeline entry point - the only command that handles **unstructured input**. This makes it the "thought organizer" that transforms raw ideas into structured exploration.

### Source Priority

| Priority | Source | Flag | Use Case |
|----------|--------|------|----------|
| 1 (Primary) | Raw text | `--input [text\|file]` | Brain dumps, ideas, thoughts |
| 2 | start.txt | `--from-start` | Project initialization context |
| 3 | Reflections | `--from-reflect [file]` | Actionable suggestions from reflection |
| 4 | Interactive | (no flag) | Prompt for topic when no input provided |

### Raw Text Input (Primary)

**When to use:** You have unstructured thoughts, ideas, or a brain dump you want organized.

**Inline text:**

```
/explore "I've been thinking about how we handle authentication.
The current system is too rigid. Maybe we need roles? Or tokens?
What about SSO? Users keep asking about Google login..."
```

**From file:**

```
/explore --input ~/thoughts/auth-ideas.txt
```

**What happens:**

1. Input parsed for themes and patterns
2. Related thoughts grouped together
3. Questions extracted for research topics
4. Scaffolding created with organized structure

### start.txt Input

**When to use:** Starting a new project or exploring project initialization notes.

**Command:**

```
/explore --from-start
```

**Auto-detection:**

- Searches for `start.txt` in current directory
- Falls back to project root
- Error if not found

**What happens:**

1. start.txt content parsed
2. Project goals extracted as themes
3. Open questions identified
4. Exploration scaffolding reflects project context

### Reflection Input

**When to use:** You have actionable suggestions from a `/reflect` output.

**Command:**

```
/explore --from-reflect admin/planning/notes/reflection-2026-01-10.md
```

**What happens:**

1. Reads "Actionable Suggestions" section from reflection
2. Converts suggestions into exploration themes
3. Preserves suggestion context in output
4. Creates bridge between `/reflect` → `/explore` pipeline

### Interactive Mode (Default)

**When to use:** Quick exploration when you just have a topic name.

**What happens when no input source specified:**

1. Prompts: "What topic would you like to explore?"
2. Uses topic name only (no additional context)
3. Generates exploration based on topic

**Note:** Interactive mode produces less context-rich scaffolding than raw text input.

### Theme Extraction

When processing unstructured input, `/explore` organizes content into themes:

**Extraction Process:**

1. **Parse input** for distinct ideas, concerns, or topics
2. **Group related thoughts** into thematic clusters
3. **Name themes** with descriptive, concise titles
4. **Preserve context** - original thoughts appear under themes

**Example Transformation:**

**Input (raw text):**

```
I've been thinking about improving our auth system. The current JWT approach
is okay but tokens expire too quickly. Users complain about re-logging in.
Maybe we need refresh tokens? Also thinking about adding Google SSO -
users keep asking. Security audit mentioned we need MFA too.
```

**Output (themes in scaffolding):**

```markdown
## 🔍 Themes

### Theme 1: Token Expiration & User Experience
- JWT tokens expire too quickly
- Users complain about re-logging in
- Consider refresh token pattern

### Theme 2: Third-Party Authentication
- Google SSO requested by users
- Reduces password fatigue
- OAuth2 integration needed

### Theme 3: Security Enhancement
- Security audit requires MFA
- Compliance consideration
- User friction vs security tradeoff
```

**Theme Naming Conventions:**

- Use descriptive nouns/noun phrases
- Avoid generic names like "Issue 1" or "Topic A"
- Capture the essence of grouped thoughts
- Keep names concise (2-5 words)

### Question Extraction

`/explore` identifies questions from input and generates `research-topics.md`:

**Extraction Process:**

1. **Identify explicit questions** - Text ending in "?"
2. **Identify implicit questions** - Statements implying uncertainty ("maybe", "not sure", "consider")
3. **Convert to research questions** - Rephrase as investigable questions
4. **Prioritize** - Order by apparent importance in input

**Question Markers:**

| Marker | Example | Conversion |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Explicit "?" | "Should we use JWTs?" | Direct research question |
| "Maybe" | "Maybe we need refresh tokens" | "Should we implement refresh tokens?" |
| "Not sure" | "Not sure about OAuth scope" | "What OAuth scopes are appropriate?" |
| "Consider" | "Consider MFA options" | "What MFA options exist?" |
| "What about" | "What about SSO?" | "Should we implement SSO?" |

**Example:**

**Input:**

```
Maybe we need refresh tokens? What about Google SSO? 
Not sure how MFA would affect user experience.
```

**Output (research-topics.md):**

```markdown
### Topic 1: Refresh Token Implementation

**Question:** Should we implement refresh tokens for better user experience?
**Priority:** High

### Topic 2: SSO Integration

**Question:** Should we implement Google SSO?
**Priority:** Medium

### Topic 3: MFA User Impact

**Question:** How would MFA affect user experience?
**Priority:** Medium
```

## Worktree Integration

`/explore` implements lazy worktree creation aligned with [ADR-002 Self-Contained Feature Branches](../../../decisions/worktree-feature-workflow/adr-002-self-contained-feature-branches.md).

### Setup Mode (No Worktree)

Setup mode stays on current branch (typically `develop`):

- Creates lightweight scaffolding (~60-80 lines)
- Low investment, acceptable to abandon on develop
- **No worktree prompt** - keeps exploration friction low

**Why:** Quick explorations shouldn't require worktree overhead.

### Conduct Mode (Worktree Prompt)

Conduct mode prompts for worktree creation:

```
/explore my-idea --conduct

Create worktree for this exploration? [Y/n]
```

**If Yes:**
- Creates directory: `worktrees/feat-my-idea`
- Creates branch: `feat/my-idea`
- Continues exploration on feature branch

**If No:**
- Stays on current branch
- Continues exploration without worktree

**Why:** Conduct mode represents real investment; prompts at natural decision point.

### Explicit Control Flags

For automation and scripting, use explicit flags:

| Flag | Behavior | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| `--worktree` | Creates worktree without prompting | CI/automation, scripting |
| `--no-worktree` | Skips prompt, stays on current branch | Quick explorations, existing worktree |

**Naming Convention:**

| Element | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Directory | `worktrees/feat-[topic]` | `worktrees/feat-auth-system` |
| Branch | `feat/[topic]` | `feat/auth-system` |

### ADR-002 Alignment

This pattern aligns with the worktree feature workflow:

- **Setup on develop:** Scaffolding is lightweight, acceptable on develop
- **Conduct on feature branch:** Serious investment is self-contained
- **Natural gate:** Setup → Conduct transition is meaningful commitment point

---

**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
```

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Identify Topic

**Default behavior:**

- If topic provided, use it
- Otherwise, prompt user: "What topic would you like to explore?"
- Sanitize topic name:
  - Convert to kebab-case
  - Remove special characters
  - Replace spaces with hyphens

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Topic identified
- [ ] Topic name sanitized
- [ ] Topic doesn't already exist (check existing explorations)

---

### 2. Determine Mode

**Mode Detection Logic:**

The command detects which mode to use based on flags and existing content.

**Setup Mode (default):**

1. Check if topic directory exists
2. If exists, check exploration.md status
3. If status is `🔴 Scaffolding`, suggest using `--conduct`
4. If status is `✅ Expanded`, warn about overwriting
5. If doesn't exist, proceed with setup

**Conduct Mode (`--conduct`):**

1. Check if topic directory exists
2. If doesn't exist, error: "No scaffolding found. Run setup first."
3. Check exploration.md status
4. If status is `✅ Expanded`, warn and require `--force` to re-expand
5. If status is `🔴 Scaffolding`, proceed with conduct

### Input Source Validation

Before mode detection, validate input source:

1. **Check for mutually exclusive flags:**
   - `--input` + `--from-start` → Error
   - `--input` + `--from-reflect` → Error
   - `--from-start` + `--from-reflect` → Error

2. **Validate source exists:**
   - `--input file.txt` → Check file exists
   - `--from-start` → Check start.txt exists
   - `--from-reflect [file]` → Check reflection file exists

3. **Validate source format:**
   - Reflection file must have "Actionable Suggestions" section
   - start.txt must not be empty

**Error Messages:**

| Situation | Message |
|-----------|---------|
| `--conduct` with no scaffolding | "No exploration scaffolding found for [topic]. Run `/explore [topic]` first." |
| `--conduct` on already expanded | "Exploration already expanded. Use `--force` to re-expand." |
| Setup on existing scaffolding | "Scaffolding exists. Use `--conduct` to expand, or `--force` to overwrite." |
| Multiple input sources | "Error: --input, --from-start, and --from-reflect are mutually exclusive" |
| Input file not found | "Error: Input file '[path]' not found" |
| start.txt not found | "Error: start.txt not found in current directory or project root" |
| Reflection file missing | "Error: Reflection file '[path]' not found" |
| Reflection missing section | "Warning: No 'Actionable Suggestions' section found in reflection" |
| Empty start.txt | "Error: start.txt is empty" |
| `--worktree` in Setup Mode | "Warning: --worktree flag ignored in Setup Mode" |
| `--no-worktree` in Setup Mode | "Warning: --no-worktree flag ignored in Setup Mode" |
| `--worktree` + `--no-worktree` | "Error: --worktree and --no-worktree are mutually exclusive" |
| Worktree already exists | "Worktree exists at [path]. Switching to existing worktree." |
| Branch already exists | "Branch [name] exists. Use existing branch? [Y/n]" |

**Force Flag Behavior:**

- `--force` with Setup Mode: Overwrites existing scaffolding (creates fresh)
- `--force` with Conduct Mode: Re-expands even if already expanded

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Check if `--conduct` flag provided
- [ ] Check if topic directory exists
- [ ] Check exploration.md status (if exists)
- [ ] Handle error cases appropriately
- [ ] Apply `--force` logic if needed

### Conduct Mode Worktree Prompt

After mode validation, if entering Conduct Mode:

1. **Check worktree flags:**
   - `--worktree` present → Create worktree automatically
   - `--no-worktree` present → Skip prompt, continue on current branch
   - Neither → Prompt user

2. **Prompt flow (if no flag):**

```
Create worktree for this exploration? [Y/n]
```

- Default: Yes (press Enter)
- Creates worktree and switches to feature branch

3. **Worktree creation:**
   - Directory: `worktrees/feat-[topic]`
   - Branch: `feat/[topic]`
   - Uses `scripts/worktrees.sh` if available

---

### 3. Setup Mode: Create Scaffolding

**Use when:** Mode detection indicates Setup Mode (no `--conduct` flag, no existing exploration or `--force` used).

**Location Detection:**

- **Dev-Infra:** `admin/explorations/[topic]/`
- **Template Structure:** `docs/maintainers/planning/explorations/[topic]/`
- **Project-Wide:** `docs/maintainers/planning/explorations/[topic]/`

**Auto-detection:**
- Check if `admin/explorations/` exists → use dev-infra structure
- Check if `docs/maintainers/planning/explorations/` exists → use template structure
- Otherwise → use project-wide structure

**Creates:** See [Setup Mode Output](#setup-mode-output) for templates (~60-80 lines total)

**Process:**

1. Create exploration directory: `explorations/[topic]/`
2. Create `README.md` hub (~20 lines) with quick links
3. Create `exploration.md` scaffolding (~40-50 lines) with placeholders
4. Create `research-topics.md` scaffolding (~20-30 lines) with prioritized questions
5. Update explorations hub with new exploration link

**Setup Mode Checklist:**

- [ ] Exploration directory created
- [ ] Exploration hub created (~20 lines)
- [ ] Exploration scaffolding created (~40-50 lines)
- [ ] Research topics scaffolding created (~20-30 lines)
- [ ] Status set to `🔴 Scaffolding (needs expansion)`
- [ ] Explorations hub updated

**Commit (docs can push directly):**

```bash
git add explorations/[topic]/
git commit -m "docs(explore): create [topic] exploration scaffolding"
git push origin develop
```

---

### 4. Conduct Mode: Expand Scaffolding

**Use when:** Mode detection indicates Conduct Mode (`--conduct` flag provided, scaffolding exists).

**Reads:** Existing scaffolding from `explorations/[topic]/`

**Creates:** See [Conduct Mode Output](#conduct-mode-output) for expanded templates (~200-300 lines total)

### Worktree Creation (Conduct Mode Only)

**After mode detection, before expanding scaffolding:**

1. **Check worktree flags:**
   - If `--worktree`: Proceed to step 2
   - If `--no-worktree`: Skip to scaffolding expansion
   - If neither: Prompt user

2. **Create worktree (if applicable):**
   - Directory: `worktrees/feat-[topic]`
   - Branch: `feat/[topic]` from current HEAD
   - Switch to worktree directory

3. **Verify worktree:**
   - Check branch is correct: `git branch --show-current`
   - Check working directory: `pwd`

**Worktree Checklist:**

- [ ] Worktree prompt handled (flag or user response)
- [ ] Worktree created (if applicable)
- [ ] Branch verified
- [ ] Working directory is worktree (if created)

**Commit Guidance:**

- If worktree created: First commit on feature branch
- If no worktree: Commit to current branch

**Process:**

1. Read existing `exploration.md` scaffolding
2. Expand themes with detailed analysis, connections, implications, concerns
3. Expand questions with context, sub-questions, research approach
4. Add initial thoughts with evidence, opportunities, concerns
5. Update `research-topics.md` with context and rationale for each topic
6. Update status from `🔴 Scaffolding` to `✅ Expanded`

**Conduct Mode Checklist:**

- [ ] Existing scaffolding read and understood
- [ ] Themes expanded with detailed analysis
- [ ] Questions expanded with context and sub-questions
- [ ] Initial thoughts documented with evidence
- [ ] research-topics.md expanded with context
- [ ] Status updated to `✅ Expanded`

**Commit (docs can push directly):**

```bash
git add explorations/[topic]/
git commit -m "docs(explore): expand [topic] exploration with detailed analysis"
git push origin develop
```

## Integration with Other Commands

### Input Sources in Pipeline

```
Raw thoughts → /explore --input "..."   ← Primary entry point
start.txt   → /explore --from-start     ← Project initialization
/reflect    → /explore --from-reflect   ← Reflection pipeline
    ↓
/explore [topic]              ← Setup: scaffolding (~60-80 lines)
    ↓ human review
/explore [topic] --conduct    ← Conduct: full exploration (~200-300 lines)
    ↓
/research --from-explore      ← Research: investigate topics
```

**Input Source → Output Quality:**

| Input Source | Output Quality | Notes |
|--------------|----------------|-------|
| Raw text (rich) | High | Themes and questions from user context |
| start.txt | Medium-High | Project-focused exploration |
| Reflection | Medium-High | Suggestion-focused exploration |
| Topic only | Medium | AI-generated without user context |

---

### Command Pipeline Position

```
/explore [topic]              ← Setup: scaffolding (~60-80 lines)
    ↓ human review            ← KEY CHECKPOINT: validate direction
/explore [topic] --conduct    ← Conduct: full exploration (~200-300 lines)
    ↓
/research --from-explore      ← Research: investigate topics
    ↓
/decision --from-research     ← Decisions: create ADRs
    ↓
/transition-plan --from-adr   ← Planning: create phases
    ↓
/task-phase 1 1               ← Implementation: execute phases
```

**Note:** Human review between Setup and Conduct is the key checkpoint. This allows:
- Quick validation of exploration direction before full investment
- Course correction with minimal time spent
- Rejection of dead-end explorations without wasted effort

### Timing Guidance

| Stage | Time Investment | Output |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| Setup Mode | ~5-10 min | Scaffolding for review (~60-80 lines) |
| Human Review | ~2-5 min | Go/no-go decision on direction |
| Conduct Mode | ~20-30 min | Full exploration (~200-300 lines) |
| Research | ~1-2 hours | Research documents + requirements |
| Decision | ~30 min | ADR documents |
| Planning | ~30 min | Feature plan + phases |

### Worktree in Pipeline

```
/explore [topic]              ← Setup on develop (no worktree)
    ↓ human review
/explore [topic] --conduct    ← Prompt: "Create worktree?" 
    ├─ --worktree            → Auto-create worktree
    ├─ --no-worktree         → Skip, stay on branch
    └─ [Y/n]                 → User decides
    ↓
worktrees/feat-[topic]/       ← Feature branch (if created)
    ↓
/research --from-explore      ← Research on feature branch
    ↓
/decision → /transition-plan → /task-phase
```

**Worktree Decision Point:**

| Stage | Branch | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Setup Mode | develop | Lightweight scaffolding, no worktree |
| Conduct Mode | develop OR feat/* | Depends on prompt response |
| Research onwards | feat/* | Should be on feature branch |

### Exploration → Research → Decision → Planning Flow

1. **`/explore [topic]`** - Start exploration (Setup Mode)
   - Creates scaffolding with placeholders
   - Organizes thoughts into themes
   - Outputs: `research-topics.md` scaffolding

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Feature Idea

**Situation:** You have an idea for a new feature

**Action:**
```bash
/explore new-feature-idea
```

**Output:**
- Exploration document created
- Research topics identified
- Ready for research phase

---

### Scenario 2: Proof of Concept

**Situation:** Want to explore a proof of concept

**Action:**
```bash
/explore poc-distributed-caching
```

**Output:**
- Exploration document created
- Research topics identified
- Ready for research phase

---

### Scenario 3: Raw Text Brain Dump

**Situation:** You have unstructured thoughts about a feature idea.

**Action:**

```bash
/explore "I want to add a notification system. Users should get
alerts for important events. Maybe email? Push notifications?
What about in-app badges? Need to think about user preferences too."
```

**Output:**
- Exploration scaffolding with 3-4 themes (notification channels, user preferences, etc.)
- research-topics.md with prioritized questions
- Status: `🔴 Scaffolding (needs expansion)`

---

### Scenario 4: New Project from start.txt

**Situation:** Starting a new project with initialization notes in start.txt.

**Action:**

```bash
/explore --from-start
```

**Output:**
- Exploration based on project goals from start.txt
- Themes organized around project objectives
- Questions extracted from open items in start.txt

---

### Scenario 5: Reflection to Exploration

**Situation:** You ran `/reflect` and want to explore the actionable suggestions.

**Action:**

```bash
/explore --from-reflect admin/planning/notes/reflection-2026-01-10.md
```

**Output:**
- Exploration themes from reflection's "Actionable Suggestions"
- research-topics.md populated from suggestions
- Bridges reflection → exploration → research pipeline

---

### Scenario 6: Exploration to Feature Branch

**Situation:** You've validated an exploration in Setup Mode and want to fully develop it.

**Action:**

```bash
# Step 1: Setup mode on develop (quick scaffolding)
/explore notification-system

# Step 2: Review scaffolding, decide to proceed
# ...

# Step 3: Conduct mode (prompts for worktree)
/explore notification-system --conduct

# Output:
# Create worktree for this exploration? [Y/n] y
# Creating worktree: worktrees/feat-notification-system
# Creating branch: feat/notification-system
# Switched to worktree directory
```

**Result:**
- Full exploration (~200-300 lines) on feature branch
- Self-contained per ADR-002
- Ready for `/research` phase

---

### Scenario 7: Quick Exploration (No Worktree)

**Situation:** You want to quickly expand an exploration without worktree overhead.

**Action:**

```bash
/explore quick-idea --conduct --no-worktree
```

**Result:**
- Full exploration on current branch
- Skips worktree prompt
- Useful for explorations that may not become features

## Tips

### When to Use

- **New ideas** - Start exploration before jumping to research
- **Proof of concepts** - Organize thoughts before research
- **Abstract concepts** - Structure thinking before investigation

### Best Practices

- **Be specific** - Clear topic names help organization
- **Identify questions** - Focus on what needs to be researched
- **Prioritize topics** - Mark high/medium/low priority research topics
