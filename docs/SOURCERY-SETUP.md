# Setting Up Sourcery AI for Dev Toolkit

> **üí° Note:** Sourcery is **optional**! All core dev-toolkit features (git-safety, hooks, config) work without it.  
> See [Optional Features Guide](OPTIONAL-FEATURES.md) for details.

Sourcery is an AI code reviewer that automatically reviews your pull requests. This guide shows you how to set it up for the dev-toolkit repository.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Rate Limits

Before installing Sourcery, understand the free tier limitations:

### Free Tier
- **500,000 diff characters per week**
- **Resets:** Every Monday
- **What counts:** Every line added or removed in your PRs

### What This Means
- **Small PRs (< 100 lines):** ~5,000 chars = 100 PRs/week ‚úÖ
- **Medium PRs (< 500 lines):** ~25,000 chars = 20 PRs/week ‚úÖ
- **Large PRs (> 1000 lines):** ~50,000+ chars = 10 PRs/week ‚ö†Ô∏è

### When You Hit the Limit
Sourcery will comment on your PR:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Weekly rate limit exceeded (500,000 diff characters)
Your limit will reset on [date]
```

**What still works:**
- ‚úÖ All dev-toolkit core features (git-safety, hooks, config)
- ‚úÖ Previous Sourcery reviews (still visible on GitHub)
- ‚úÖ Manual code reviews

**Options:**
1. **Wait** - Limit resets weekly
2. **Upgrade** - Sourcery Pro for unlimited reviews
3. **Use Core Features** - Toolkit works great without Sourcery!

## What is Sourcery?

Sourcery is a GitHub App that:
- üîç Automatically reviews your PRs
- üí° Suggests code improvements
- üéØ Identifies potential issues
- üìä Provides quality metrics

The `dt-sourcery-parse` command extracts these reviews into readable markdown files with priority matrices.

## Testing Sourcery

### Create a Test PR

```bash
# Create a test branch
git checkout -b test/sourcery-setup

# Make a small change
echo "# Test" >> TEST.md
git add TEST.md
git commit -m "test: Verify Sourcery integration"
git push -u origin test/sourcery-setup

# Create PR
gh pr create --title "test: Verify Sourcery integration" --body "Testing Sourcery AI code review"
```

### Wait for Sourcery Review

Sourcery typically reviews PRs within 1-2 minutes. You'll see:
- A comment from `sourcery-ai[bot]` on your PR
- Review comments on specific lines (if applicable)
- Overall code quality metrics

### Parse the Review

Once Sourcery has reviewed:

```bash
# Parse the review
dt-sourcery-parse <PR_NUMBER>

# Or save to file
dt-sourcery-parse <PR_NUMBER> -o docs/reviews/sourcery-review.md

# With detailed reasoning
dt-sourcery-parse <PR_NUMBER> --think
```

---

## Configuration (Optional)

### Create `.sourcery.yaml`

Add custom Sourcery configuration to your repository:

```yaml
# .sourcery.yaml
rules:
  - id: no-long-functions
    description: Functions should be less than 50 lines
    pattern: |
      def $FUNC(...):
        $$$BODY
    condition: len($$$BODY) > 50

python_version: "3.11"

github:
  request_review: author
  sourcery_branch: sourcery/main
```

### Common Settings

```yaml
# Enable/disable specific checks
rules:
  - id: use-fstring-for-formatting
    enabled: true
  
  - id: no-unnecessary-pass
    enabled: false

# Set review thresholds
thresholds:
  quality: 75
  complexity: 10
```

---

## Using Sourcery Reviews

### 1. View Review on GitHub

Visit your PR to see Sourcery's inline comments and overall review.

### 2. Extract with dt-sourcery-parse

```bash
# Basic extraction
dt-sourcery-parse 1

# Save to file
dt-sourcery-parse 1 -o admin/reviews/pr-1-sourcery.md

# Include reasoning
dt-sourcery-parse 1 --think

# Structured details
dt-sourcery-parse 1 --rich-details
```

### 3. Use the Priority Matrix

The parser generates a priority matrix template:

```markdown
| Comment | Priority | Impact | Effort | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| #1      |          |        |        |       |
| #2      |          |        |        |       |
```

Fill it out to prioritize which suggestions to implement.

## Rate Limits

### Free Tier Limits

Sourcery's free tier includes:
- **500,000 diff characters per week**
- Resets weekly
- Covers most small to medium projects

**What counts as diff characters?**
- Lines added/removed in your PRs
- Larger PRs = more characters
- Multiple PRs accumulate

### Rate Limit Reached

If you see:
```
Sorry @username, you have reached your weekly rate limit of 500000 diff characters.
```

**Options:**

1. **Wait for Weekly Reset**
   - Rate limits reset every week
   - You can still view existing reviews
   - New PRs will be reviewed after reset

2. **View Reviews on GitHub**
   - Sourcery still comments on PRs
   - Security issues are highlighted
   - Inline suggestions are visible
   - Just can't use `dt-sourcery-parse` until reset

3. **Upgrade to Pro**
   - Unlimited reviews
   - Priority support
   - Advanced features
   - Visit: https://sourcery.ai/pricing

### Managing Usage

**Tips to stay within free tier:**

1. **Review smaller PRs**
   - Break large changes into smaller PRs
   - Each PR uses fewer diff characters

2. **Focus on important code**
   - Skip documentation-only PRs
   - Review logic changes primarily

3. **Use selectively**
   - Not every PR needs Sourcery review
   - Focus on complex changes

4. **Check usage**
   - Sourcery shows remaining quota in rate limit messages
   - Plan PRs accordingly

### Rate Limit Detection

The `dt-sourcery-parse` command automatically detects rate limits:

```bash
dt-sourcery-parse 1
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  Sourcery rate limit reached
# 
# üìä Rate Limit Information:
# 
# Sorry @username, you have reached your weekly rate limit...
#
# ‚ÑπÔ∏è  About Sourcery Rate Limits:
#    ‚Ä¢ Free tier: 500,000 diff characters per week
#    ‚Ä¢ Resets weekly
#    ‚Ä¢ Upgrade available for unlimited reviews
```

## Troubleshooting

### Sourcery Not Reviewing

**Check installation:**
```bash
gh api /repos/grimm00/dev-toolkit/installation
```

**Verify permissions:**
- Go to: https://github.com/settings/installations
- Click "Configure" next to Sourcery
- Ensure "Pull requests" permission is enabled

**Trigger manually:**
- Close and reopen the PR
- Push a new commit to the PR branch

### No Review Found

```bash
dt-sourcery-parse 1
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  No Sourcery review found for PR #1
```

**Possible causes:**
1. Sourcery hasn't reviewed yet (wait 1-2 minutes)
2. PR has no code changes (only docs/config)
3. Sourcery is not installed
4. PR is from a fork (Sourcery may not review forks)

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check if PR exists
gh pr view 1

# Check for Sourcery comments
gh pr view 1 --comments | grep sourcery

# Wait and try again
sleep 60 && dt-sourcery-parse 1
```

### Parse Errors

```bash
# Enable verbose mode
dt-sourcery-parse 1 --think

# Check raw review data
gh api /repos/grimm00/dev-toolkit/pulls/1/reviews
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Review Early and Often

Run Sourcery on every PR to catch issues early:

```bash
# After creating PR
gh pr create --title "feat: New feature" --body "Description"

# Wait for Sourcery
sleep 120

# Parse and review
dt-sourcery-parse $(gh pr list --author "@me" --json number --jq '.[0].number')
```

### 2. Use Priority Matrix

Don't implement every suggestion blindly:
- üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Security, stability issues ‚Üí Implement immediately
- üü† **HIGH**: Bug risks ‚Üí Implement before merge
- üü° **MEDIUM**: Code quality ‚Üí Implement if time allows
- üü¢ **LOW**: Nice-to-haves ‚Üí Optional

### 3. Save Reviews

Keep a record of Sourcery reviews:

```bash
mkdir -p admin/reviews
dt-sourcery-parse $PR_NUM -o admin/reviews/pr-$PR_NUM-sourcery.md
git add admin/reviews/
git commit -m "docs: Add Sourcery review for PR #$PR_NUM"
```

### 4. Learn from Patterns

Look for recurring suggestions across PRs to identify areas for improvement.

## Integration with Workflow

### Automated Review Parsing

Add to your workflow:

```bash
# After PR creation
gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."

# Wait for Sourcery
echo "Waiting for Sourcery review..."
sleep 120

# Parse and save
PR_NUM=$(gh pr list --author "@me" --limit 1 --json number --jq '.[0].number')
dt-sourcery-parse $PR_NUM -o admin/reviews/pr-$PR_NUM-sourcery.md

# Review the file
cat admin/reviews/pr-$PR_NUM-sourcery.md
```

### Pre-merge Checklist

Before merging:
1. ‚úÖ Sourcery review completed
